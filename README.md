# arduino_blink
Simple blinking arduino program!!!! :)
It will blink with rate of 3 seconds delay!

This program shows a basic example of what can be achieved using Arduino board!

Here we use #define directive to create macro,which holds the pin number.
In this way we make the modification of program easier!
